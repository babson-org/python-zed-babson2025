def ai_move(board: list[int]):
    """
        Simple AI that selects the first available cell.
        Remember board is a list that starts with items 1 - 9
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        
        after two moves with X choosing 1 and O choosing 5 the board looks like:
        [10, 2, 3, 4, -10, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        
        so in this case your function should return 2

    for i, cell in enumerate(board):
     if cell !=10 and cell != -10:
        return i
